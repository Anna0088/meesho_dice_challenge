```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run these before committing:

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

**Key Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over promises
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Example Code Style

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the Seller Quality Score
 * @param metrics - The seller metrics
 * @returns The calculated SQS value
 */
export async function calculateSQS(
  metrics: SellerMetrics
): Promise<number> {
  const weights = {
    productQuality: 0.4,
    customerSatisfaction: 0.3,
    operationalEfficiency: 0.3,
  };

  const score =
    metrics.productQuality * weights.productQuality +
    metrics.customerSatisfaction * weights.customerSatisfaction +
    metrics.operationalEfficiency * weights.operationalEfficiency;

  return Math.round(score * 100);
}
```

### API Design Guidelines

- Use RESTful conventions
- Version your APIs (`/api/v1/`)
- Return consistent response formats
- Include proper error handling
- Document with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Commit Messages
